*List Comprehensions* are a special kind of syntax that let us create lists out of other lists in a concise way ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_comprehension), [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions)). They are incredible useful when dealing with numbers and with one or two level of nested *for loops*. Beyond that, they can become a little too hard to read.

In this short article, we are going to make some for loops and rewrite them, step by step, into *comprehensions*. If everything goes well, at the end and as a bonus, we will know how to do the same with [sets](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org/#sets) and [dictionaries](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org/#Dictionaries-and-Structuring-Data).

## Basics

We already said it: a *List Comprehension* allows us to create lists out of other lists. And even when they are not too complex, they are still a bit difficult to understand at first because, I think, they look weird. Why? Well, the order in which they are written is the ***opposite*** of what we usually see in a *for loop*.

```python
names = ['Charles', 'Susan', 'Patrick', 'George', 'Carol']

for n in names:
    print(n)

# Charles
# Susan
# Patrick
# George
# Carol
```

In this loop we have:

- `for n in names:` Created a variable `n` that will contain each of the items in the `names` list.
- `print(n)` Done something with that variable. In this case, we just print the current value of `n`.

Now, to do the same but with a *list comprehension* we start at the very end of the for loop:

```python
names = ['Charles', 'Susan', 'Patrick', 'George', 'Carol']
[print(n) for n in names]

# Charles
# Susan
# Patrick
# George
# Carol
```

Notice how we inverted the order:

- First we defined what the output of the loop will be `[print(n) ...]`.
- and then we created our variable and state the list (or [set](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org/#Set-comprehension)/[dictionary](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org/#Dictionaries-and-Structuring-Data)) we will work on `[... for n in names]`.

Not that difficult right?

## Creating a new List from a Comprehension

This is how we create a new list from an existing collection with a for loop:

```python
names = ['Charles', 'Susan', 'Patrick', 'George', 'Carol']

new_list = []
for n in names:
    new_list.append(n)

print(new_list)
# ['Charles', 'Susan', 'Patrick', 'George', 'Carol']
```

And this is how we do the same with a *list comprehension*:

```python
names = ['Charles', 'Susan', 'Patrick', 'George', 'Carol']

new_list = [n for n in names]
print(new_list)
# ['Charles', 'Susan', 'Patrick', 'George', 'Carol']
```

We can assign it to `new_list` because a *list comprehension* standard behavior is to return a list:

```python
>>> names = ['Charles', 'Susan', 'Patrick', 'George', 'Carol']
>>> [n for n in names]
['Charles', 'Susan', 'Patrick', 'George', 'Carol']
```

*Comprehensions are so cool*.

## Adding Conditionals

What if we want `new_list` to have only the names that start with `C`? With a for loop we would do it like this:

```python
names = ['Charles', 'Susan', 'Patrick', 'George', 'Carol']

new_list = []
for n in names:
    if n.startswith('C'):
        new_list.append(n)

print(new_list)
# ['Charles', 'Carol']
```

In a *list comprehension*, we add the if statement at its end:

```python
names = ['Charles', 'Susan', 'Patrick', 'George', 'Carol']

new_list = [n for n in names if n.startswith('C')]
print(new_list)
# ['Charles', 'Carol']
```

Isn't more readable this way? *Comprehensions are the kings of short loops* (!).

## Formating long List Comprehensions

This time, we want `new_list` to have not only the names that start with a `C` but also those that end with an` e` and contain a `k`:

```python
names = ['Charles', 'Susan', 'Patrick', 'George', 'Carol']

new_list = [n for n in names if n.startswith('C') or n.endswith('e') or 'k' in n]
print(new_list)
# ['Charles', 'Patrick', 'George', 'Carol']
```

Well, that is messy ðŸ™„.

Fortunately, it is possible to break comprehensions in different lines:

```python
new_list = [n for n in names if n.startswith('C')
            or n.endswith('e') or 'k' in n]
```

## Set and Dict Comprehensions

If you have learned the basics of *list comprehensions*... Congratulations! you just have done it with [sets](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org/#Set-comprehension) and [dicts](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org/#Dictionaries-and-Structuring-Data)!

Set comprehension:

```python
my_set = {"abc", "def"}

# Here, we create a new set with uppercase elements using a for loop
new_set = set()
for s in my_set:
    new_set.add(s.upper())

print(new_set)
# {'DEF', 'ABC'}

# The same, but with a set comprehension
new_set = {s.upper() for s in my_set}
print(new_set)
# {'DEF', 'ABC'}
```

Dict comprehension:

```python
my_dict = {'name': 'Christine', 'age': 98}

# A new dictionary out of a existing one using a for loop
new_dict = {}
for key, value in my_dict.items():
    new_dict[key] = value

print(new_dict)
# {'name': 'Christine', 'age': 98}

# Using a dict comprehension
new_dict = {key: value for key, value in my_dict.items()}  # Notice the ":"
print(new_dict)
# {'name': 'Christine', 'age': 98}
```

## Conclusion

I don't know about you, but every time I learn something new there is this urge to use it right away. When that happens (because it happens a lot in this field), I force myself to stop and think for a moment. In this case, is it really ok to change this big, nested and already messy looking for loop (stupid Carlos, what kind of code have you been writing) to a comprehension? Probably not, because you know:
