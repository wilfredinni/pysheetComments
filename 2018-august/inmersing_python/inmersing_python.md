As a self-taught Developer, I think that one of the most important things when starting to learn a new skill is to surround ourselves with all the things that can help us improve. We can read Blogs, follow developers on Twitter, read and contribute to their projects on GitHub, subscribe to the different mailing list that exists, and of course, we can't forget the YouTubers that have put online and free of charge, thousands of hours of content so we could just keep getting better and better at this. 

In this post, I want to share all the assets that I have collected to this point. It may not be much, but they really have helped me.
