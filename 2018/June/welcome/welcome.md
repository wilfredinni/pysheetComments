Anyone can forget how to make [character classes for a regex](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org#Making-Your-Own-Character-Classes), [slice a list](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org#Getting-Sublists-with-Slices) or do a [for loop](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org#Using-for-Loops-with-Lists). This cheat sheet tries to provide a basic reference for beginner and advanced developers, lower the entry barrier for newcomers and help veterans refresh the old tricks.

## How to use it

It's very easy, just go to the [python cheatsheet](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org) and use **ctrl/cmd+z** to open the *quick search* and start typing!

If you are curious, the page renders a markdown file directly from the [Project Repository](https://github.com/wilfredinni/python-cheatsheet) and with some javascript, it indexes all the titles, subtitles and creates the anchor links, so every time a change is committed, the website is automatically updated.
